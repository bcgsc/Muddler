# Muddler
Simulating Chromothripsis
# Dependencies and installation
Tested on python 3.9.12
Python packages: 
Biopython, Pybedtools
Versions tested:
Biopython=1.79
pybedtools=0.9.0

I used anaconda to install these into an environment with their dependencies.
`conda create -n muddler`
`conda activate muddler`
As biopython installs via pip rather than a conda recipe, you can install it to the conda environment
`conda install pip`
Then find the location of this installed pip. For example the path to pip could be:
`/anaconda/envs/muddler/bin/pip`
Installing biopython to the muddler environment
`/anaconda/envs/muddler/bin/pip install biopython`

For installing muddler
`git clone https://github.com/bcgsc/Muddler.git`
